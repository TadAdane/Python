# ðŸš€ Guess the Number Game

This is a simple "Guess the Number" game implemented in Python using the SimpleGUI library. The user can choose between two ranges (0-100 or 0-1000) and try to guess the secret number within a limited number of guesses.

## ðŸ•¹ How to Play

1. Choose a range by clicking one of the two buttons: "Range is [0, 100)" or "Range is [0, 1000)".
2. Enter your guess in the input field and press Enter.
3. The game will provide feedback whether your guess is higher or lower than the secret number.
4. Keep guessing until you find the secret number or you run out of guesses.

## ðŸ–¥ Implementation Details

The game is implemented in Python 2.7 using the SimpleGUI library. The secret number is generated using the `random` library and the number of guesses is computed based on the range size using the `math` library.

## Credits

This game was developed as part of the "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)" course on Coursera. The original version of the game was created by Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong.
